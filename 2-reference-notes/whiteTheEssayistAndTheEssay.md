# Purpose

Outlines a dichotomy between people who seem to value and not value essays.

Sincerity is the backbone of the essay format regardless of countless structures it could take.

There's a freedom in essays. To try. To experiment. To play with being a role your not used to embodying. With honesty and sincerity as his guide, the essayist is free to explore wherever he wished to venture. (I tried to do his thing about making abstract people feel real)

# Artfulness

Mentions Montaigne having "the gift of natural [candor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/candor)" then ties back Montaigne in the last lines as a person that White could embody when he's feeling down in the dumps.

> _“The essayist arises in the morning and, if he has work to do, selects his garb from an unusually extensive wardrobe: he can pull on any sort of shirt, be any sort of person, according to his mood or his subject matter—philosopher, scold, jester, raconteur, confidant, pundit, devil's advocate, enthusiast.”_
> (“In depth: essayists for our time”, 1993, p. 746)

^ Using a wardrobe and clothing as figurative language for assuming a new role as an essayist makes it clear how easy it is to changes perspective or goals when writing as essay

> The essayist, unlike the novelist, the poet, and the playwright, must be content in his self-imposed role of second-class citizen. A writer who has his sights trained on the Nobel Prize or other earthly triumphs had best write a novel, a poem, or a play, and

^ White talks about the "essayist", "poet", or "writer" as people in a story. Like I could replace every 'writer' in the essay with a proper name like 'John' and it would have the same gravity. I can see them as real people instead of just the 'idea of a writer'

# Personality

> _"...there are Howard Johnson ice creams."_

^ picking a specific brand of ice cream to relate to makes me feel like he appreciates ice cream

> _"I like the essay"_

^ Uses first person language to describe what he find helpful about the essay form and how he "falls back on it"

> _"I have always been aware that I am by nature self-absorbed and egoistical; to write of myself to the extent I have done indicates a too great attention to my own life, not enough to the lives of others."_

^ Critics himself and agrees with the naysayers who many argue that essays are egotistical and self-absorbed.

# Lines of Inquiry

**There aren't wrong thoughts! You're just thinking about what you read. (just take time to think and write your thoughts)**

##### _White claims that "there are as many kinds of essays as there are human attitudes or poses," and that the essayist can "be any sort of person, according to his mood or his subject matter." What "sort of person" does White appear to be in this piece?_

##### _How would you characterize his "mood" and his "attitudes"? How is your impression of him shaped by his ideas? By the way he develops his ideas? By the way he words his ideas?_

##### _What relationship do you see between the kind of person he appears to be and the subject matter he discusses?_

##### **(ZK)** _White maintains that the essayist "cannot indulge himself in deceit or in concealment." How do you square this assertion with his previous statement about all of the "poses" that are available to the essayist? How is it possible to assume a pose in writing without engaging "in deceit or in concealment?"_

Understanding White's seemingly contradictory statements lies within the way the essayist's assumes his poses. If the essayist decided to be a philosopher for an essay, he's not pretending to be Socrates. Instead, he's connecting with the 'philosopher' part of his identity - whatever that may mean for him - and brings his philosophical characteristics into the writing.

'Assuming a pose' is synonymous with 'connecting with aspects of oneself'. If the essayist wants to be a jester, he connects with the funny aspects of himself. If he wants to be a philosopher, he connects with the self-reflective aspects of himself. If he wants to be an activist, he connects with the caring and combative aspects. **People are a complex intersection of identities and assuming a 'pose' simply magnifies an identity within said complexity.**

##### _How is it possible to assume a pose while also being "self-centered"?_

Taking the perspective of assuming a pose as magnifying the part of oneself, it's clear to see how this could still be considered "self-centered". The essayist still creates essays as a means to explore their interests and frames his essays within a personal perspective.

##### _What exactly do you think White believes about the relationship between the sort of person an essayist appears to be in writing and the sort of person an essayist actually is?_

_How does White's idea about the "poses" of an essayist compare with Hoagland's assertion that "the artful 'I' of an essay can be as chameleon as any narrator in fiction"?_

_How does White's idea compare with Woolf 's belief that the "problem" for every essayist is "never to be yourself and yet always" to be yourself?_

**(ZK)** _What relationship do you think exists between the sort of person you are and the sort of person you appear to be in your writing?_
My first thought was, "I appear to be someone whose trying to hard in their writing", hoping overuse of prose will make me sound smarter. But, it feels like my prose is shoving square blocks into triangle holes. It's the biggest disconnect I have when writing- the desire to sound authentically smart with the brain of a 7th grade English student.

The relationship between me and my 'written self' is dichotomous. I'm either comfortably grabbing an academic tweed suit or no wardrobe at all. As a writer, I have little experience in wearing the variety of poses that White describes. I'm my entire self, or playing the role of an 'academic' - often nothing in between.

# **(ZK)** Are essays egotistical?

White argues that essayist happily enjoys the work of freely expressing their thoughts, but are likely motivated by ego or self-importance.

> “some people find the essay the last resort of the egoist, a much too self-conscious and self-serving form for their taste;” (“In depth: essayists for our time”, 1993, p. 747)

However, if a writer were to write an essay but never publish it, is the essay still "the last resort of the egoist?" Publishing is the only part of the practice one could claim is egotistical. An author's desire to publish his observations and thoughts for readers to engage could be perceived as an act of egoism. However, the discipline of essays is simply mental journeying and expression.

Those claiming essays are egotistical would also assert learning and reasoning itself be reserved for the egoist.

**Do essays imply publication?**
