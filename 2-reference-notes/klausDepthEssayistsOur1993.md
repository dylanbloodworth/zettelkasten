## Introduction: On The Essay
[Essays are routinely used to give the write and readers pleasure. Some think of the pleasure of an essay to be a journey.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=20&annotation=EN4QV399) | #essay/purpose

*“it seems useful to begin by considering what essayists mean by the pleasure of the essay and how it can go hand in hand with a serious approach to experience and ideas.”*
[Essays give people pleasure which can be defined differently for different people.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=20&annotation=NSJFV78E) | #essay/purpose, #pleasure

*“the way that essayists describe the pleasure of the essay, you can also discover something about the nature of the essay”*
[Until recently, I maybe never considered essays to be pleasurable. Journals presented a therapeutic experience that allowed me to express emotions in their most compromised form. I think narrative essays may give that same feeling somehow](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=20&annotation=7TMXJ2SS) | #pleasure, #essay

*“origin of the word "essay," which comes from the French verb essayer, meaning literally to attempt or to try. Each new excursion of the essayist, each new "attempt," differs from the last and takes him into new country.”*

[Essays are a means of trying things out, exploring, attempting.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=20&annotation=DU5QACIQ) | mental journey

**(ZK)** *“"How do I know what I think until I see what I've said?”*
[writing is a discovery of knowledge](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=21&annotation=5AMPG82Y) | writing as thinking

**(ZK)** *“Essayists usually prefer to take a less predetermined, more venturesome, approach to writing”*
[As a physicist by trade, it's hard to shake this outlining, researching, and citing that comes with the scientific article process. It feels wrong to take another approach to writing and have it be taken "serious" and not be "just a journal entry"](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=21&annotation=VATZUI9L) | conflicts with STEM, open form

*“In short, the essay is an open form.”*
[Essays explore in a way that doesn't contain the writer as other forms of writing might](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=21&annotation=PAMNTARZ) | essays, open form

*"The essay is an open invitation to you to "hybridize into forms that suit the times."*"

[Essays as a discipline need to have pointedness (purpose). They differ however, in that they are artful and personality driven.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=22&annotation=CVIH4M6Y) | essay/discipline, purpose

 *“though more wayward or informal than an article or treatise, somewhere it contains a point which is its real center, even if the point couldn't be uttered in fewer words than the essayist has used.”*
[essays should make a point](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=22&annotation=9AW6A3PN)| essay/discipline, purpose

*“Pointedness, as Hoagland implies, is perhaps the essayist's most important source of discipline,”*
[If your essay doesn't have a purpose, then it's not a good essay](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=22&annotation=VDNFKX2E) | essay/discipline, purpose

*“George Orwell's "Marrakech" may at first glance appear to consist of five completely separate and unrelated segments, each of which offers a snapshot-like description of a different scene in and around Marrakech. But if you look at the essay closely, you'll see that those snapshots provide a progressively more disturbing picture of the colonial world at work at Marrakech. Similarly, Russell Baker's "Completely Different" at first glance seems to be a disconnected sequence of sentences, but a close examination of those sentences reveals that they are connected to each other by their critique of contemporary American society.”* 
[example of who Orwell uses the open essay form to convey a point about american society](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=22&annotation=UNWY5GKD) | purpose, example

**(ZK)** *“Without such a clear sense of purpose, of pointedness, even the most carefully organized piece of prose would be a hollow bit of writing.”*
[Essays should have purpose and attach strongly to an idea](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=22&annotation=PMZ5YLYC) | essay/discipline, purpose

[Essays have an artistic quality that conveys strong personality while being purposeful](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=23&annotation=4KWSRGUI) | art of writing, essay/discipline

*“The only thing that could, in fact, account for both of their claims is what both of them refer to as "personality" in the essay—the sense of a human presence that you can hear and feel and see at work whenever you are reading an essay and giving it your sole attention.”*
[essays embody the personality of the author which grabs us as readers](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=23&annotation=H78QQ7DS) | personality, essay/discipline

[What it means to have personality in your writing is complex, situational, and ever-changing.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=24&annotation=4V3S8LJG) | essay/discipline, personality

*“it entails perhaps the most difficult of all balancing acts in writing: "Never to be yourself and yet always to be yourself"”*
[essays can never grasp the entire scope of your personality, so writers must balance what is important for the context of the essay.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=24&annotation=43HJGEIF) | personality, essays/discipline

**(ZK)** *“Because an essay consists of words, it embodies an essentially fictional version of yourself.”*
[language lacks the ability to 'represent' the self](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=24&annotation=LIX248JQ) | language, essays

*“The best you can hope for, then, in any piece of writing is to be true to some aspect of yourself that bears on whatever you are writing about at that moment.”*
[Essays themselves are limited in scope to the purpose and may not include important, but irrelevant aspects of yourself.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MS7KQVP?page=24&annotation=S35GI8BQ)  | limited personality, essays

*“E. B. White says, "The essayist . . . can pull on any sort of shirt, be any sort of person, according to his mood or his subject matter—philosopher, scold, jester, raconteur, confidant, pundit, devil's advocate, enthusiast.”*

**(ZK)** *“To the writer, it offers an inexhaustible set of possibilities for giving voice to experience, thought, and belief in an artful and authentically human way. To the reader, it offers equally rich possibilities for witnessing other minds, other personalities, in action.”*
