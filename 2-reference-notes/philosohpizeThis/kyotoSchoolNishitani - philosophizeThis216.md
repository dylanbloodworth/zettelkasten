> you can FAKE…a relationship that you have with death. Having never actually even ENCOUNTERED it.

^ Our understanding of death is fairly shallow and purely theoretical. It's one of the few things everyone can never truly contend with in practice.


> if Nishitani’s GOAL here is to examine Nihilism in a way that has never really been done before…an important PIECE of that is going to be to ENGAGE with the tradition of how thinkers in the WEST are already APPROACHING this problem.

^ Understanding an idea involved actively engaging with the idea and the work around it.
*what does it mean to engage with ideas?*

> Nietzsche says that to truly CONTEND with Nihilism FULLY…means you have to NOT live in this passive, reactive way…no, it’s an ACTIVE process, we have to creatively differentiate, we have to create our OWN values and projects from a place of affirmation. In other words: taking Nihilism SERIOUSLY to Nietzsche…means OVERCOMING NIHILISM… via the self, and the WILL.

> I, the self, CREATE VALUES… in each moment moving forward…and this supposedly is going to SOLVE the problem of Nihilism, that there AREN’T actually values WRITTEN into the universe for me to follow.

> And what we’re LEFT with when we DO To understand something, you need to engage with the work o this whole strategy Nishitani says…is a sort of POSITIVE response to Nihilism…that’s a CLASSIC kind of response that comes out of a western style of thinking. The idea is: that Nihilism…is a problem to be SOLVED.

^ 'Positive response' to Nihilism is a western approach to understanding Nihilism. It frames Nihilism as being understood through realizing it's a 'thing' that people need to actively overcome when it appears in our lives.

When meaning is missing, you take in the world and make meaning for yourself. This 'fixes' nihilism.
