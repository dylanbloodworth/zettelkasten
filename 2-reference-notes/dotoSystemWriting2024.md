## Introduction

[methodology for writing with notes](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=D5K2Y2CL) | workflow

_“The structure of a Luhmann-style zettelkasten is not predetermined. It emerges out of the relationships the note maker establishes between ideas recorded in the notes. As relationships develop, areas of the zettelkasten swell.”_
[Structure is emergent, not predetermined to confine thoughts into boxes](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=SQVQNYSX) | workflow

["koans"](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=Z3K5VNRW) | vocab

_“If you feed your zettelkasten with ideas, it will grow.”_
[ideas are the backbone of the workflow](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=MLMVKB7L) | ideas

[all notes are a system of feedback loops](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=AGYTQNDR) | workflow

## Ch 1. Capture Your Thoughts

**(ZK)** : _“While humans excel at generating insights, our capacity to retain them is limited. We’re forgetful. We lose our train of thought.”_
[i forget too many things](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=CJLML5UA) | external structures, retention

_""Fleeting notes” helps us distinguish disconnected, passing thoughts from the ideas that will soon be networked inside our slip box. We use the term “fleeting notes” not because they’re of a particularly high value, but because of the value we place on the notes they’ll become."_
[all fleeting notes are important, but may not become ideas](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=2SXQDVGT)| notes/fleeting, external structure

**(ZK)** [fleeting notes are not useful on their own](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=JK8KEYGG). I have yet to make this shift | notes/fleeting, workflow

[fleeting notes remind of an thought. they're not the idea](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=JSFFP88S) | notes/fleeting

[how is it possible to remember what's in a zettel?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=LQQM6IXG) | workflow

_“since not every thought you have will be relevant to your interests and writing, not all fleeting notes will become main notes”_
[Assuming every fleeting note becomes a main note puts pressure on me to cherry pick writing fleeting notes](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=9D8KZ62E) | notes/fleeting

_“Not all fleeting notes need be transformed into main notes. For best results, practice non-attachment when it comes to fleeting notes.”_
[filter notes after they've been written, not before](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=HIABDHMS) | notes/fleeting

**(ZK)** : [force yourself to put amorphous ideas into words](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=3IRK2GJ6) | writing as thinking, external structure

**(ZK)** : _“Struggling to put an idea into words forces us to wrestle with the language through which that idea will be expressed. Rather than being a means of recording what we already believe, writing, even in the form of short notes, helps us understand what we think we know”_
[ideas are formed through writing not internal contemplation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=PXY6MGBT) | writing as thinking

**(ZK)** : _“it took writing to know what they wanted to write.”_
[writing is thinking](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=TI388XXS) | writing as thinking

## Ch 2. Taking Notes while Reading (or Watching or Listening...)

[the self referential nature of the notes is a key part of the zettel methodology](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=GAXSARJV)

**(ZK)** : _“So, don’t be afraid to capture ideas that rub you the wrong way.”_
[does nitpicking disagreements lead to better understanding?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=YL74ZX6I) | argumentation

**(ZK)** : _"Instead of seeing...novels as mere entertainment,...I see them as doing a certain kind of cultural work within a specific historical situation, and value them for that reason. I see their plots and characters as providing society with a means of thinking about itself....”_
[trying to force myself to have an idea about this quote. Is that forcing good?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=27FT6LD2) | workflow
-> see Luhmann quote in Ahren pg 11

_“Feel free to capture anything that excites you for whatever reason.”_
[is this too much freedom in the practice?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=VLSAI8RJ) | notes/reference

**(ZK)** : _“Anything that shows up while reading—external references, feelings, past and current events, a conversation you had earlier in the day—anything that gives you insight into what you think about what you’re encountering is grist for the writing mill.”_
[making comments about what the reading makes you feel](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=Q43NSNFP) | workflow, reading

[marginalia isn't sacred. write whatever interests and then review when pulling to a reference note.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=SY52AAF8) | workflow, notes/reference

[his marginalia system seems much simpler than mine. How simple could a system get while still being effective?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=B7R4H8PW) | reading, workflow
How can paper marginalia systems be adapted to online reference platforms? | workflow

**(ZK)** : _"It’s the “going back” that makes all the difference, understanding that your initial scribble isn’t the end of the capture. It’s the beginning.”_
["going back" through notes as a form of active recall?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=WDGIQC2I) | learning, writing as thinking

**(ZK)** : _“You don’t need to understand an idea’s relevance to your thinking to cite it in a reference note. Reading is not note-taking, and you should feel free to cite anything that catches your attention, regardless if it will eventually make it into your slip box.”_
[only purpose for taking a note is to capture that brief moment of curiosity the material elicits in you regardless of context](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=CNC3GLCP) | workflow, reading
Don’t become overprotective of your main notes to the point where you stop making them. A main note’s contents can be as simple as an idea and a link to other ideas. Don’t get bogged down with trying to create “perfect” main notes. Remember: an idea’s value is determined by its relationship to other ideas.

## Ch 3. Making Main Notes

![[thoughtnoteTomainnote.excalidraw|100%]]

[main notes have a simple required structure](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=W5BGDX3F) | notes/main

[other things can be added to main notes to increase their individual value](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=LDDJND2D) | notes/main

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=LL3WJV4Z) “It should be a declarative statement rather than a descriptor.33 “Not all apples are edible” is a better title than “Apples and edibility.”” ([Doto, 2024](zotero://select/library/items/4A5WRAX3)) titles need to be declarative

[declarative statements make it easier to see if ideas have already been captured. Especially with Ctrl+F](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=4Q5ZSX8F) | notes/main,

[Notes are helpful for scanning relevant information. You don't need to rehash every thought behind a note.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=M4XG476E)

_“Doing so creates a train of thought that can be retraced whenever you want to pull from the zettelkasten for a new writing project.”_
[Create trains of thought through providing reasoning for links between notes](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=358XISRE) | links, notes/main

_“The first thing to do when creating a main note from a reference note citation is to retype, copy/paste, or reference the quote you want to comment on in a new note. This serves two purposes: It reminds you of where your idea came from. It helps you decide whether your idea is restating the quote or if the idea was merely inspired by the quote."_
[reference notes should also include citations and reference the quotes to comment on](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=Y4U9ILJ7) | links, citations

_“If, when making a main note, a new idea comes to mind, take advantage of the opportunity to add it to your zettelkasten.”_
[if a another idea comes to mind while writing the main note, make another main note!](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=5SR57FYF) | notes/main, workflow

[Re-frame questions into a declaration to reflect on it's importance. ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=LIGC24PV) | questions, notes/main

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=AJJNBWFA)
Ways to include facts:

- rephrase (distills ideas into relevant components)
- make statements about the facts, connect to things in daily life. Integrate into your own thinking.

[Dialog with the slip-box is crucial for idea generation. Ideas can either emerge from knowing its contents and wanting to expand in light of other notes. Or, ideas can be formed away from the zettelkasten in spite of notes.] | dialogue, links

[Find short, times (maybe even while writing a note) to get to know your kasten] | dialogue

[never delete notes you disagree with later in life. instead, connect to a counter-arg providing reasoning why the new idea is better.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=FAWQQK44) | contradictions, dialogue

**(ZK)** _“Relationships between ideas are what give them value.”_
[relationships are the only thing that gives anything value (including the self?)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=7HITZ485) | relationships, links, value

_"Don’t become overprotective of your main notes to the point where you stop making them. A main note’s contents can be as simple as an idea and a link to other ideas. Don’t get bogged down with trying to create “perfect” main notes. Remember: an idea’s value is determined by its relationship to other ideas.”_
[main notes on their own aren't important or useful. It's their relationships within the zettel that are valuable.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=V75CWBK3) | relationships, dialogue, links

## Ch. 7 What to write about and how not to do it

> "Look inside your zettelkasten and see if any areas have similarly swelled. Open or take out each note to see if there’s a train of thought you’d like to unpack and develop. Then, copy/paste or rewrite the main ideas into a new document. If writing isn’t your primary objective, create a structure note following the steps laid out in chapter 6, rearranging and expanding on your ideas.”

~~**(ZK)**~~ [Long alphanumeric labels indicate trains of thought that may be worth developing further in writing or a structure note](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=CCD4WLVI) | trains of thought

> “A well-scaffolded structure note will not only show connections that have been developing in your zettelkasten, but also the reasons for those connections, and the ways in which those connections can be expressed further. All of this can be leveraged for writing. Fig. 44 in chapter 6 shows just how useful they can be. Aside from helping me better understand the ideas in my zettelkasten regarding pratyahara, with only a few editorial tweaks, this structure note could easily be transformed into a rough draft.”

[Structure notes can easily be converted into rough drafts.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=8WT67TBB)

~~**(ZK)**~~ [A single main note can be powerful enough to inspire a piece of writing.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=LQ2CK2V3) | notes/main

> “I’d start by copy/pasting the main idea into a new document making sure to include the title, quote, and source (you never know if you’ll need it). I’d then follow the links mentioned in the note, repeating the same steps for every idea that caught my attention (8.2). Once I had all of this material in place, I’d begin the process of outlining the piece (8.5) along with editing and rewriting the copy to fit both the appropriate tone and cadence.” (

>  "terrible writer.  The ideas you’ve been capturing in your main notes weren’t written in the context of any one specific piece of writing.” 

~~**(ZK)**~~ [The zettelkasten lacks context to the specifics of arguments within a piece of writing.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=JPYMAZPX) 

> “Even Sönke Ahrens, who praises Luhmann’s productivity, states that his work suffers from “trying to put too much in,”117 a critique of zettelkasten users that appears to be somewhat common”

[ :(](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=4MNTVPNG) 

>“Despite the connections you’ve made and the reasoning you’ve given for each one, relationships between ideas must be reframed in the context of the piece you’re working on. This means rewriting ideas, shaping them to express what you want.” 

>“Semantic connective tissue should pull the ideas into alignment.

## Ch. 8 Writing for readers

> “Receiving immediate feedback on your ideas can lead to interesting conversations that challenge or confirm your beliefs. But, when insightful responses to your posts are captured and imported into your zettelkasten as main notes, a social media platform like Mastodon or Twitter becomes a co-creative environment, where consistent posting establishes a feedback loop of content creation (Fig. 53).”

~~**(ZK)**~~  [Social media can be seen as an fairly immediate to further develop ideas due to perspectives from others.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=7WB7HTR5) 

> “Whenever you encounter a comment worth saving, turn it into a main note by first pasting the comment into a new note, making sure to credit and link back to the comment. Then, state your thinking about what was said. This will become the main idea in your note. Finally, network the idea as you would any other, establishing connections between it and others stored in your zettelkasten.”

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=A86LFA2C) 

> “Creating a blog post from main notes is relatively straightforward: 
> 1.  Choose a note.  
> 2. Rewrite the idea to fit the tone and tenor of your blog, adding any additional information or connections as needed. 
> 3. Relate the idea to other posts you’ve written and/or comments you’ve received.  
> 4. Consider connections to other notes to see where you might take this idea in subsequent posts.  
> 5. Title and upload the post.”

**(~~ZK~~)** [Blog posts can also be derived from a single main notes, with surrounding notes to make new posts.](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=5GSVYVZQ) 


> “With long-form writing, the process is a dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up approaches, where writers frequently oscillate between the two, adapting their strategy based on the evolving needs of the writing.”

[\*](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=FPBDJ9M5) 

> “This oscillation reflects the flexibility inherent in the writing process, where the natural ebb and flow between these approaches contribute to a more rich and nuanced final result.”
