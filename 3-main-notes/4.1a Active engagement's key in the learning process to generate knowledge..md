Actively engaging with ideas, material, and concepts is how people truly construct a base of knowledge. Passivity with material (restating, copying, etc.) typically doesn't lead to generating knowledge.

> “When students accept that they, rather than their teachers, their parents, other people, or other factors, are primarily responsible for constructing the meanings that represent their success or failure in school, their learning is likely to increase.” (Osborne and Wittrock, 1985, p. 66)
