John Steinbeck argues that stopping to revise during the writing process is an excuse for not making progress with writing. There will be future times for revision.

> "Write freely and as rapidly as possible and throw the whole thing on paper. Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down. Rewrite in process is usually found to be an excuse for not going on. It also interferes with flow and rhythm which can only come from a kind of unconscious association with the material."
