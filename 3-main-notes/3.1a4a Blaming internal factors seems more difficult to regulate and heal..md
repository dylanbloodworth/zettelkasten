Title: 3.1a4a Blaming internal factors seems more difficult to regulate and heal
---

Self-regulating emotions that attribute blame to internal factors are difficult to manage. One could simply forget a guilty situation and write it off as a fluke. However, making judgments on character traits hits the core of the person. It's more difficult to write that off as a fluke.

_I think it's cool to point out that I wrote this whole main note before seeing that quote from Tracy and Robins :)_

> “shame is considerably more painful and self-esteem-damaging than guilt” (Tracy and Robins, p. 196)
