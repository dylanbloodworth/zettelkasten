People who criticize me for not accomplishing my goals make it easy for shame to rear it's ugly head. It feels like the person is giving me the words to load a blame gun for shooting myself. There's no self-interpretation of missing the mark. I missed the mark, which I feel is inconsistent with who I want to be in life, and I can attribute that to being a _failure_ of a person.
