Title: 3.1a4 Shame seems more common that guilt in my experience
---
I'm more likely to attribute blame to the internal factors of myself as opposed to the external actions I may perform.

- previous [[3.1a Shame and guilt attribute negative events to the self.]]

---

- see [[3.1a4a Blaming internal factors seems more difficult to regulate and heal.]] for a discussion of why the damage from shame could be greater.
- see [[2.1b Internal factors are the source of motivation for external actions]] to support the claim that shame is more prevalent because it's an internal factor.
