> ["Look inside your zettelkasten and see if any areas have similarly swelled. Open or take out each note to see if there’s a train of thought you’d like to unpack and develop. Then, copy/paste or rewrite the main ideas into a new document. If writing isn’t your primary objective, create a structure note following the steps laid out in chapter 6, rearranging and expanding on your ideas.”](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R6EZAKMC?page=null&annotation=CCD4WLVI)
