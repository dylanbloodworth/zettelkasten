Writing involves expressing oneself to the world, as people desire to share their thoughts and feelings. We share parts of ourselves for others to engage with in meaningful ways.

> You hit publish, and nothing happens.
> No likes.
> No shares.
> Silence.
> But writing isn’t about applause.
> It’s about leaving pieces of yourself for someone else to find.
> Sometimes it takes days.
> Sometimes it takes years.
> But write anyway.
