Dialogical engagement in the classroom serves to co-create knowledge through participation in student-student discussion (think-pair-share dialogue) and student-teacher discussion (Socratic dialogue). 

> " But the SWITCH here to Freire is that when the relationship BETWEEN the students and the teachers is more equal…students… are going to LEARN from the discussion, by PARTICIPATING and thinking it through…and the TEACHER is ALSO going to set out with the intent to LEARN along WITH the STUDENTS as they give the lesson. To use Freire’s term there is a co-creation of knowledge that starts to happen, between the teacher and student. That there DOESN’T always need to be a PARENT in the room and a CHILD in the room all the time…that there are ways that ADULTS can come together through MUTUAL respect and PRODUCE good things through dialogue."
